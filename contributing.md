# Contributing

## Preparing

To contribute to this project, you shall first create a fork of it on Github.

Then, you should clone your fork to your computer with a command:

`git clone git@github.com:<username>/pic-a-pix`

After you clone your fork, you should add another remote repository that points to this project. You can do this with:

`git remote add <custom_name> git@github.com:mkalitka/pic-a-pix`

This allows you to pull commits stored at main repo with:

`git pull <custom_name> main`

**DO NOT push commits directly to main repo.**

## Commiting

Before making a commit on local repo, I suggest to look at your changes with:

`git status` and `git diff`

All changes will be seen on Github when creating pull request. Try not to do unnecessary changes.

To commit your changes, you should push your commits to your fork with:

`git push origin main`

Then, create a pull request in main repo that points to your fork.

After its changes are accepted by whole group, your work will appear here. ðŸ˜Š
